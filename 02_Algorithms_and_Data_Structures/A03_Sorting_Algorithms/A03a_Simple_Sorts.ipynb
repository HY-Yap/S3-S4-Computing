    "\n",
    "Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.\n",

    "The name bubble sort comes from the way smaller or larger elements \"bubble\" to the top of the list.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# N is the number of elements in the array\n",
    "# iterate i as \"bubble pass number\" from 0 to N-1 exclusive\n",
    "# this is for N numbers, we need to perform N-1 bubble passes\n",
    "for i from 0 to N-1:\n",
    "    # iterate j as \"index\" for j from 0 to indexOfLastUnsortedElement-1 (exclusive)\n",
    "    # indexOfLastUnsortedElement can be obtained from N-i (exclusive)\n",

    "\n",
    "Time complexity is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It is commonly expressed using the big O notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, when we talk about efficiency of an algorithm, we are referring to its time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if an algorithm's time complexity is `O(n)`, it means that the algorithm will take `n` units of time to run, where `n` is the length of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Complexity: O(n)\n",
    "def print_list(lst):\n",
    "    for i in range(len(lst)):\n",
    "        print(lst[i])\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basics of Big O Notation\n",
    "- Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's running time as a function of the input size.\n",
    "- It focuses on the growth rate rather than exact times.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rules for Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Single Loop:**\n",
    "   - If an algorithm has a single loop that iterates `n` times with constant time operations inside, the time complexity is `O(n)`.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Iterating through an array of size `n` and performing a constant time operation on each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Nested Loops:**\n",
    "   - If an algorithm has `k` nested loops, each running `n` times with constant time operations inside, the time complexity is `O(n^k)`.\n",
    "   - **Example:** A double nested loop where both loops run `n` times each has a time complexity of `O(n^2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Divide and Conquer:**\n",
    "   - For divide and conquer algorithms like merge sort and quick sort, the time complexity is `O(n log n)`.\n",
    "   - **Example:** In the next chapter, we will discuss and understand how merge sort splits the array into halves (`log n` divisions) and then merges them back (`n` operations per level).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Simplification in Big O Notation:**\n",
    "   - Ignore constants in Big O notation. For example, `O(2n)` simplifies to `O(n)` and `O(3n^2)` simplifies to `O(n^2)`. The constants become negligible for large input sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Combining Multiple Algorithms:**\n",
    "   - When combining multiple algorithms, the overall time complexity is dominated by the highest order term. For example, `O(n) + O(n^2)` simplifies to `O(n^2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To have a better understanding of time complexity, you may refer to the following links:\n",

    "### _4.2 Space Complexity_\n",
    "\n",
    "Space complexity is the amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It is commonly expressed using the big O notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if an algorithm's space complexity is O(n), it means that the algorithm will take n units of memory to run, where n is the length of the input.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Best case** is the scenario where the algorithm performs the best. \n",
    "- **Worst case** is the scenario where the algorithm performs the worst. \n",
    "- **Average case** is the scenario where the algorithm performs in the middle of the best and worst case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best case for bubble sort is when the array is already sorted. This is because the algorithm will only perform `1` pass through the array. Hence, the best case time complexity is `O(n)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The worst case for bubble sort is when the array is sorted in reverse order. This is because the algorithm will perform `N-1` passes through the array. Hence, the worst case time complexity is `O(n^2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average case for bubble sort is when the array is randomly sorted. The average case time complexity is still `O(n^2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### _4.4 In-place vs Out-of-place_\n",
    "\n",
    "An in-place algorithm is one which transforms input using a data structure with a small (constant) amount of extra storage space. An algorithm that is not in-place is out-of-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bubble sort, insertion sort and selection sort are in-place algorithms. This is because they do not require extra storage space to perform the sorting.\n",
